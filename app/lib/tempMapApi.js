It’s a significant step in the city’s plan to wind down operations and close the airport after 2028. The 5,000-foot runway will … </p>"

      "<p>Santa Monica’s newest star is Tallula’s, a beachy gem by way of the Rustic Canyon restaurant group situated just up the Pacific Coast Highway. This place is full of summertime vibes and casual Mexican favorites, making it a new must-stop for anyone heading to the beach. Seriously, check out this cheery space, filled with color and rustic surfside touches. There’s the hand painted wood columns, the tile flooring, the mosaic carpeting, the old wood benches with the carvings in the back. More modern affectations include a tall open ceiling, metal bar chairs, and loads of natural sunlight, but this is truly a Malibu-adjacent charmer with all the wonderful trappings of a sunlit surfer’s cove from days gone by.</p>"

      "<p>It is almost officially summertime and the living should be easy, but sometimes (for some of us) money can be tight. Luckily for those in Southern California this summer, Santa Monica’s annual “Twilight Concerts” will return and will be free to the public. Santa Monica’s annual summer concerts tradition first started in 1983 to bring awareness to the pier’s reconstruction after one-third of it was destroyed by winter storms. The city has kept the tradition ever since, making it a prominent part of the culture of Southern California. The concert series is hosted by the nonprofit Santa Monica Pier Corporation and sponsored by the popular mobile application company Snapchat.</p>"

      "<p>The recent rain didn’t stop art lovers and gallery enthusiasts from attending the Lois Lambert Gallery’s opening reception for Cuban artist Edel Bordón and Los Angeles-based artist Martiros Adalian on Saturday March 10. Slowed down guests, perhaps, but not stopped, because inside the gallery a tapestry of artful conversations filled air. Martiros Adalian’s paintings lined the walls of the front exhibition room. “It has been three years since I exhibited here,” said Adalian. The works he selected for this exhibition were evocative of seated portraits commissioned by Baroque era nobility, but modern due to the incorporated yellow caution tape motif that stretched across the walls.</p>"
